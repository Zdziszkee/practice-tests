    {
      "question": "What are the primary colors in the RGB color model?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Red", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Green", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Blue", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Yellow", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Cyan", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "In the RGB (additive) color model used for digital displays, the primary colors are Red, Green, and Blue."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which color is created by mixing blue and yellow paint?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Orange", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Purple", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Green", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Brown", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "When mixing blue and yellow paint, you get green. This follows the subtractive color model (CMYK) used in physical media."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of these colors have a wavelength longer than 600 nanometers?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Blue", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Green", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Orange", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Red", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "Colors with longer wavelengths appear toward the red end of the spectrum. Red has the longest wavelength (around 700nm), followed by orange (around 620nm)."
